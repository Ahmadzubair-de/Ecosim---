# EcoSim

Yo! I created this Ecosystem Simulation using python. I donâ€™t have much time to work on it because of school, but I hope you find it fun and useful. Feel free to use or modify it!

## Features
- Creatures with individual stats: HP, Hunger, Thirst, Love, Damage
- Food and water sources that respawn after a set time
- Mating between creatures of the same type
- Combat between different creature types
- Aging and dynamic sight radius reduction
- Real-time statistics for population, deaths, and kills

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.x: [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Install Pygame


## Usage
- Click on a creature to view its stats
- Press `P` to pause or resume the simulation


## Side Notes
Learn this project on your own, because I dont have time (right now bcuz of school) to make a tutorial video or anything .
Btw, if you find some German comments in the code, just ignore them (Iâ€™m German ðŸ˜…).
